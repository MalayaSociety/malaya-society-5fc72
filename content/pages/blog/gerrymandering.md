title: Gerrymandering
subtitle: >-
  Gerrymandering is the act of politicians manipulating the redrawing of
  legislative district lines in order to help their friends and hurt their
  enemies. They may seek to help one party win extra seats (a partisan
  gerrymander), make incumbents of both parties safer (an incumbent-protection
  gerrymander) or target particular incumbents who have fallen out of
  favor.Those engaged in gerrymandering rely heavily on winner-take-all voting
  rules. That is, when 51% of voters earn 100% of representation, those drawing
  districts can pack, stack and crack the population in order to make some votes
  count to their full potential and waste other votes. Gerrymandering has become
  easier today due to a combination of new technology to precisely draw
  districts and greater voter partisan rigidity that makes it easier to project
  the outcome of new districts.
