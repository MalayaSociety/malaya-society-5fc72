title: Gerrymandering
subtitle: >-
  Gerrymandering is the act of politicians manipulating the redrawing of
  legislative district lines in order to help their friends and hurt their
  enemies. They may seek to help one party win extra seats (a partisan
  gerrymander), make incumbents of both parties safer (an incumbent-protection
  gerrymander) or target particular incumbents who have fallen out of favour.
