Happy Earth Day! In chairing the first meeting of the Malaysian Climate Change Action Council (MyCAC) last week, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin outlined six approaches that will be implemented by the government to address climate change issues. From ensuring careful carbon trading activities to driving the use of low carbon transportation, we speak to Alizan Mahadi, Director, Technology, Innovation, Environment and Sustainability Division, at ISIS Malaysia to discuss where Malaysia stands right now and if our initiatives are enough to nudge Malaysia forward as a new green economy.

**1. Malaysia has a long road ahead**

Since the Green New Deal launched by former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930’s during the Great Depression, it is no secret that the climate has deteriorated rapidly in recent years, resulting in staggering amounts spent on green infrastructure and initiatives. However, Malaysia still has quite a long way to go to match the leaders in this field, if Budget 2021 is anything to go on: less than 1% of its budget was allocated for the environment. 

**2. Money talks**

According to Alizan, the low return on investment for green infrastructure may be the reason for the deprioritisation of funds we’ve seen in the space. However, this is changing. With the impact of climate change becoming more apparent and an increasing environmental focus within leading economies like the US and the EU, there is hope that more countries like Malaysia will follow suit, hopefully in the near future.

**3. Are we on track?**

The Ministry stated that it will meet the country’s voluntary commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to achieve a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity per unit of GDP by 2030. According to the latest report in 2016, Malaysia is on track at a 29% reduction. However, the UN Climate Conference 2021 (26th Conference of the Parties) which will be held at the end of this year is calling for stronger ambitions by all countries to accelerate progress. Looks like it’s time for us to revisit our goal.

**4. Renewable energy and conservation initiatives to accelerate progress**

There are two main strategies Alizan mentions that we could look at to further reduce emission intensity. These include essentially reducing our emissions through the use of renewable energy and increasing efficiencies of green energy, as well as increasing the number of carbon sinks through forest preservation, tree-planting initiatives, and conservation projects.

**5. Aggressive measures to decarbonise land transportation**

The low carbon mobility development plan for 2021 aims for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 165 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. “At the current rate of 55 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year, we would need to reduce about 3 years’ worth of transportation emissions by 2021,” says Alizan.

Having said that, with constant concerted efforts from all stakeholders to increase the use of public transport, fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as consistent conservation initiatives, Alizan is optimistic that we can achieve that goal, despite these aggressive targets.

History has its eyes on us, as the nation and the world strives for a better world. Do you think Malaysia is ready for a green economy? Let us know your opinion in the comments this World Earth Day!

#### The British Malaya Society's take:

Malaysia is in a great position to take advantage of the decline of prices of green energy and electric vehicles, from public transport to personal vehicles, the prospect of a green future looks promising, something Malaysia could invest and lead the region in now. Though renewables and electric vehicle uptake has been slow, we expect this to ramp up as renewable energy and electric vehicle options, and pricing improve. The government must create an economy so that businesses and individuals can create a greener and healthier future for Malaysia.

Electric vehicles with a dirty grid. Though Alizan Mahadi has mentioned the lack of efficiency gained from a coal-intensive grid, running new electric vehicles are still more environmentally friendly than fossil powered alternatives, according to a [study done by the Universities of Cambridge, Exeter and Nijmegen](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/electric-cars-better-for-climate-in-95-of-the-world).
