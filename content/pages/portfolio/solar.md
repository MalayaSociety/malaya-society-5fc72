Earth day is one of the biggest annual events being held globally to support the environmental movement to protect our planet. It was founded in 1970 when thousands of people gathered together in the United States to voice out awareness about environmental issues.

With the theme “Restore our Earth”, this year’s celebration focuses on natural processes, emerging green technologies, and innovative thinking that can restore the world’s ecosystem. People are encouraged to speak-up for our Mother Nature and be part of the movement to help fight climate change.

The **British Malaya Society** believes that each of us has the power to restore our planet by making contributions in our own little ways. And this power starts in your home and our businesses. Our behaviour and habits can make a big impact in saving our Mother Earth. When you recycle at home, you are already making a contribution. By turning off your lights and other appliances when not in use, you are helping restore the Earth. When you go grocery shopping, bring an eco-bag instead of using plastic bags, you are already helping the environment heal. Businesses can show support by encouraging recycling, and deploying commercial solar.

Green technology has become cheaper over the years, it has also been developed to create environmental-friendly technologies to save and protect our ecosystem from harm. In the past few years, one of the green technologies that is making a great impact in our environment is the solar PV system. According to a report by the United Nations in 2018, solar energy dominated global investment at $160.8 billion in 2017. This shows that more and more homeowners and businesses are now joining the movement in going green by installing solar panels.

We at **The British Malaya Society** have been part of this movement for four years now. Our advocacy to help our Earth from climate change through solar energy has been making a great contribution in Malaysia. We are restoring our Earth in our own ways with our preferred energy provider ERS Energy installed projects in the country.

By offering rooftop solar photovoltaic alternatives to both commercial and residential clients alike, ERS Energy has been in the business for over a decade. After a few awards, milestones and having built Malaysia’s biggest solar project (2008), ERS Energy still offer the same budget-friendly prices for the best brands in solar. From small homes to commercial projects – big or small; be it a single solar panel, a complete solar power system, maybe even a utility-scale solar development with financial support. **The British Malaya Society** and ERS Energy are here for all your solar PV solutions provider.

**The British Malaya Society** encourages our partners in all industries to install on their roof rather than arable land. We take great pride in helping homeowners and business owners to help save the world one system at a time–using their green energy consumption to lessen their carbon footprint. We always believe that we can make a change. And that we have the power to save our Mother Earth.
