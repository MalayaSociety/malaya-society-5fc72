We are a non-governmental society that provides various services. **The British Malaya Society** is steeped in tradition, culture, and heritage and our multi-national team of experts from a diverse and wide background provide a wide range of services, whilst having a great deal of fun through events as well!

> The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before. - Neil Gaiman

Though our primary purpose is now indeed policymaking specialising in energy, transport, security intelligence, and healthcare, we still hold our heritage with us, but now with a modern and international twist. Our members produce and host art exhibitions, various sports tournaments, the best in regional cuisines, local coffee roasteries, and national (and international) excursions. We have our fair share of artists and history experts to keep the conversations lively.

*Thank You for reading!*
